bookings.py

A FastAPI router dedicated to Booking CRUD operations within the Technician Booking System.

Endpoints:
  1. GET    /bookings
     - List all existing bookings in the system.
  2. GET    /bookings/{booking_id}
     - Retrieve details of a specific booking by its unique ID (UUID or numeric).
  3. POST   /bookings
     - Create a new booking with validated request data (customer, technician, etc.).
  4. DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}
     - Cancel or remove a booking by ID.

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes and responses,
with standardized error handling (e.g., 404 if a booking is not found).
